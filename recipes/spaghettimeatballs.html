    <p>This authentic spaghetti and meatballs recipe is made with fresh oregano and parsley. Because the meatballs are cooked in the sauce, they are tender and savory.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>3 tablespoons olive oil</b></li>
        <li><b>¾ cup chopped onion</b></li>
        <li><b>4 cloves garlic, minced</b></li>
        <li><b>2 (16 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</b></li>
        <li><b>3 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</b></li>
        <li><b>1 cup water</b></li>
        <li><b>½ cup sugar</b></li>
        <li><b>¼ cup chopped fresh oregano, divided</b></li>
        <li><b>1 dried bay leaf</b></li>
        <li><b>salt and pepper to taste</b></li>
        <li><b>1 pound ground round</b></li>
        <li><b>½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</b></li>
        <li><b>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</b></li>
        <li><b>2 eggs, lightly beaten</b></li>
        <li><b>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</b></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook the onion until lightly brown. Mix in 2 cloves garlic, and cook 1 minute. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, 1/2 the oregano, and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer while preparing meatballs.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the ground round, bread crumbs, remaining oregano, remaining garlic, parsley, eggs, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Roll into 1 inch balls, and drop into the sauce. Cook 40 minutes in the sauce, or until internal temperature of meatballs reaches a minimum of 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and stir in the spaghetti. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Serve the meatballs and sauce over the cooked spaghetti.</li>
