    <h1>Avocado Tomato Salad with Cucumbers</h1>

    <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-assets.meredithcorp.io%2F8afee8885ba0b72a3c29b0eafb6683e5%2F1663038803IMG_3439%20(2).JPG&w=596&h=399&c=sc&poi=face&q=60&orient=true" alt="picture of an Avocado salad">

    <p>This is a fusion between Greek, Italian, and Latin cultures. This salad can add a healthy, yet very hearty, satisfying blend to any dinner. 
        It is sure to release all of those endorphins including dopamine that make you feel great after pigging out at a fast food or a comfort 
        food dinner but staying as healthy as can be. How many recipes can make that claim? Well this one can!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>5 medium avocados - halved, peeled, and pitted</b></li>
        <li><b>2 large cucumbers, ends trimmed</b></li>
        <li><b>4 medium Roma tomatoes</b></li>
        <li><b>¼ cup rice wine vinegar</b></li>
        <li><b>¼ cup Italian salad dressing</b></li>
        <li><b>¼ teaspoon dried oregano leaves</b></li>
        <li><b>¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</b></li>
        <li><b>½ teaspoon sea salt, or to taste</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut avocados into wedges. Peel cucumbers, if desired, and cut into slices. Core tomatoes and cut into wedges. Transfer all to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add vinegar, Italian dressing, oregano, pepper, and salt; mix until well combined. Taste and adjust seasonings.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Avocados should be moderately smooth and not really firm. This way they will best expose that rich, buttery, nutty flavor.
        I prefer thin cucumber slices with the skin still intact, but use a carrot or apple peeler on the outside prior to slicing to make a line all the way down lengthwise the cucumber, leaving just a bit of the skin. This will look nice when sliced.
        Using rice vinegar produces a more Greek flavor. For an Italian style, use balsamic vinegar instead.</p>
